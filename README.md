# EchoAlpha: Institutional-Grade Quant Model Platform

## Vision
Build a robust, extensible platform for alternative data-driven trading. Incorporate state-of-the-art NLP and ML for alpha generation. Enable rapid research, backtesting, and live deployment of new signals. Foster a collaborative, open-source quant research community.

## Roadmap & Next Steps

### 1. Data Collection & Ingestion
- [x] Reddit, News, Twitter collectors (basic)
- [ ] Expand to more sources (e.g., StockTwits, Discord, YouTube, financial news APIs)
- [ ] Add scheduling/automation (cron jobs, Airflow, etc.)
- [ ] Real-time streaming support

### 2. Text Preprocessing & NLP
- [x] spaCy-based cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization
- [ ] Language detection and filtering (for multi-lingual support)
- [ ] Advanced entity recognition (tickers, companies, people)
- [ ] Custom stopword lists and domain-specific cleaning

### 3. Sentiment Analysis
- [x] VADER sentiment scoring
- [ ] Experiment with transformer-based sentiment models (FinBERT, RoBERTa, etc.)
- [ ] Ensemble or hybrid sentiment scoring
- [ ] Sentiment calibration for financial context

### 4. Feature Engineering
- [x] Text length, keyword counts, all-caps, punctuation
- [x] Time features (hour, day, weekend)
- [x] Source encoding
- [x] Rolling sentiment (signal smoothing)
- [ ] More advanced features: topic modeling, volatility proxies, event detection
- [ ] Feature selection/importance analysis

### 5. Alpha Model Integration
- [ ] Use features in ML or rule-based trading models (XGBoost, LightGBM, logistic regression, etc.)
- [ ] Combine sentiment with price/volume/technical features
- [ ] Model explainability and backtesting

### 6. Backtest & Live Trading
- [ ] Integrate with a backtest/live trading engine (Zipline, Backtrader, custom)
- [ ] Simulate order execution, slippage, and transaction costs
- [ ] Live signal deployment and monitoring

### 7. Deployment & Automation
- [ ] Schedule collectors and pipeline (cron, Airflow, Prefect, etc.)
- [ ] Dockerize for reproducibility
- [ ] Cloud deployment (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- [ ] Monitoring, alerting, and logging

### 8. Collaboration & Scaling
- [ ] Modularize for team contributions
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests
- [ ] Documentation and code examples
- [ ] Open source community engagement

## Features
- Collects data from Reddit, News, and Twitter (optional)
- Cleans and preprocesses text (spaCy)
- Computes sentiment scores (VADER)
- Extracts actionable NLP features (tokens, text length, keyword counts, all-caps, punctuation, etc.)
- Computes rolling sentiment for trend detection
- Outputs enriched CSVs for ML/alpha models or direct trading signals

```

## Setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv altdata-venv`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Configure API keys in `config/secrets.yaml`
5. Run collectors in `data_collection/`

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies (spaCy, vaderSentiment, pandas, praw, pyyaml, etc.)
